abstract: "Among the different sensing modalities available for robots, vision and force sensing have traditionally been the predominant ones. Physical interaction tasks, however, greatly benefit from the nuanced information provided by tactile sensors. For this reason, researchers devoted to this line of research considerable efforts for many years. The purpose of this entry is to provide an overview of the state of the art, to present the most salient recent findings, and to describe the most promising future research directions."
