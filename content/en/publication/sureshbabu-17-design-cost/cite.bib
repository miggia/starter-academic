 abstract = {A novel, low cost display which uses existing 3D printed optics technology and improves upon it by adding isolation and diffusion layers is presented. The display can transmit light source from a planar 2D surface through individual light pipes onto complex surfaces. This is achieved by a combination of total internal reflection of light in the light pipes which are embedded for minimum Fresnel losses, light isolation using structural limiters and by providing a light diffusion mask to augment contrasts. The resulting display is shown to exhibit higher contrasts, enhanced performance and minimal light loss due to scattering. An exhaustive evaluation was carried out and a user survey was done on the final result. The display is then mounted on the head of the new R1 humanoid robot.},
