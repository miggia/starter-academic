 abstract = {This paper describes the conception, design, fabrication and testing of a wrist for a new humanoid robot. The wrist is comprised of a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism actuated by three motors. The wrist was made to be lightweight and cost-efficient. The design is optimized to fit within the forearm of the robot and is equipped with joint and calibration sensors. It was then tested for consistency in performance and positioning accuracy.},
