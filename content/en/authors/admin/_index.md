I've loved making things for as long as I can remember.
I work to design high performance mechanisms with complex behaviours yet minimal embodiments, exploiting manufacturing constraints to obtain high efficiency and reduced costs.

This page features an overview of what I've been doing in the past few years.

### Short Bio

In 2006 I graduated cum laude in Mechanical Engineering from the Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.
I then moved to Genova where I started my PhD at the newly founded Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT).
There, I worked on the hardware of the iCub humanoid robot under the supervision of Lorenzo Natale, Giorgio Metta and Giulio Sandini.

After obtaining my PhD I served as the hardware lead of the iCub project as a PostDoc since 2010 and as a Techonologist since 2016.
In August 2019 I became the coordinator of IIT's mechanical design and fabrication facility.
