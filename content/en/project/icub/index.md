The iCub is a 53DOF open-source humanoid robot. Since 2007 In the years from 2007 to 2019 I have been heavily involved in the design and testing of several of its parts. Among these, the upper-body, the legs, the six-axis force-torque sensors, the covers, the legs, the hands and forearms, and the head. Since 2010, until September 2019 I have served the role of hardware lead of the project.

More details about the robot can be found on the project website: [www.icub.org](www.icub.org).
