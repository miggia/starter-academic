The goal of the R1 project was to bring the technology developed in the iCub project one step closer to the market. This problem was addressed with a design-for-manufacturing approach, novel solutions for robot mechanisms, and by a wide use of polymeric materials.

The project was of a rather large scale, involving over 30 people working in 7 different institutions in different geographical locations (Italy, Spain, Switzerland and New Zealand). The total budget of the project was around 1.1Mâ‚¬ (including personnel, consumables, and external services).

The first complete robot prototype was demonstrated in April 2016, just 16 months after the beginning of the project.
