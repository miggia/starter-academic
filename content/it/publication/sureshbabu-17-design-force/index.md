abstract: "This paper outlines the design of the hand of the R1 humanoid robot. The hand uses a completely plastic structure with embedded electronics. It has 2 actuated degrees of freedom (DOF) with 4 phalanges, coupling two phalanges to each degree of actuation. A novel series elastic module was developed within the hand. It is used in force sensing and protects the hand from impact loads. The series elastic module is designed, characterized and evaluated across the working range of the hand. The hand also has position sensors at all joints and tactile sensors for tactile feedback on its phalanges. The hand is completely self-contained with all control boards and motors housed within the structure. It is then tested and evaluated against user needs."
