abstract: In order to reduce the share of the motive power required to drive the robot's
  links, with the aim of increasing its payload-to- weight ratio, this article studies
  the best way to relocate the actuators (inertial load) but not complicate the joint
  kinematics. For this, several Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKMs) were considered,
  namely a 4-UU mechanism, a spherical 5-bar mechanism and a spherical 6-bar mechanism,
  with gimbal-like rotations. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modelling and simulations
  exploring the workspaces for each of these mechanisms was performed. The complete
  workspace and isotropy analyses comparing these mechanisms to a gimbal system are
  presented. The general observations suggest that these mechanisms posses a non-uniform
  workspace with a \"warping\" behaviour. However, the spherical six bar mechanism
  proves to be the best solution so far with isotropy nearly >= 0.9 throughout its
  workspace.
