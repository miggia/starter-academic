abstract: 'The evaluation of robotic hands is a subjectively biased, complex process.
  The fields pertaining to robotic hands are human-centric in nature, making human
  hands a good standard for benchmark comparisons of robotic hands. To achieve this,
  we propose a new evaluation index, where we evaluate robotic hands on three fronts:
  their form, features and performance. An evaluation on how anthropomorphic robotic
  hands are in basic mobility, and appearance constitutes the &ldquo;Form&rdquo;,
  while features that can be read, changed and actuated for effective control of robotic
  hands constitutes the &ldquo;Features&rdquo;. We derived these key features from
  an extensive analysis of robotic hands in literature. Finally, the robotic hands
  carry out a series of tasks that evaluate their &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;. An individual
  score for each category is drawn and we carry out a three-pronged analysis. We also
  propose an additional feature in the form of price to provide context when analysing
  multiple hands.'
