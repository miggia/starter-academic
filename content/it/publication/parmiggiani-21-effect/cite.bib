 abstract = {Recent years have seen the wide diffusion of composite materials in many manufacturing fields and the rapid evolution of additive manufacturing. Lately, these technologies have been combined practically allowing the fabrication of continuous-fiber reinforced polymer parts via 3D-printing. This topic is gaining attention both in the research community and among industrial users. Because of their novelty, such manufacturing methods are, however, still not thoroughly understood, and their performance limits have not yet been fully characterized. This study aims at analyzing the mechanical resistance of components made with continuous carbon fiber (CCF) thermoplastic materials by means of fused filament fabrication (FFF), focusing on the influence of the fiber orientation on such properties. In particular, both the tensile and the bending characteristics are evaluated according to the relative test standards, in specimens with both unidirectional and mixed-isotropic configurations. The experimental findings are compared with a set of reference specimens made with a base polymer filled with chopped "short" carbon fibers, allowing one to appreciate the advantages or limitations of the different fiber arrangements.},
